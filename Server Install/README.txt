For Plex, first, check your device to see which ARM CPU you have (assuming you're running this on a Pi) and afterwards run one of the bash scripts by either running it from the explorer, or navigating to this directory and typing ./<nameOfFileHere>

For VNC Server, check to see if it's installed on your device first. If it's not, then run ./installVNCServer.bash
